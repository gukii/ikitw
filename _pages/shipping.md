### DEDICATED SHIPPING FACILITIES

IKI uses government facilities that are dedicated to shipping fish, where customs and health inspections are close by and can be scheduled according to shipment schedules. Individual shipments are isolated and quarantained.  


### CHAIN OF CUSTODY

A chain of custody involves professional keeping and health checking of Koi at every stage within the supply chain.  
  
Our activity in education, research and certification allows IKI to establish secure supply-chain channels for transporting and handling Koi. The transparent standards of service and quality, alongside the standards enforced for certification, position IKI to create this very valuable infrastructure.  
  
Certified businesses become part of the “chain of custody”, where all supply chain members handling fish are clearly identified, tests are taken and controls are in place. The benefits of a chain of custody and certified businesses become amplified during periods of health concerns within the market.  

### PARENT KOI HEALTH CHECKS  

Health check involving blood tests and virology, ultra sound to determine the gender and state of eggs, use of X-ray to ensure Koi bones and bubble are without problem. The Koi get chipped and receive a IKI certificate in addition to the certificate of origin by the Koifarm (e.g. Sakai or Sing Chang).  

### PARENT KOI TRADE  
  
All Koi sold by IKI are of high-grade with certified origins. They are purchased, shipped and handled with the uttermost care. A number of health checks are applied before and after their shipment.   

Our suppliers include the most notable Koi farms in Japan and Taiwan, among time Sakai Fishfarm and Sing Chang Koifarm of Taiwan.
